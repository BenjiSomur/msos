## Scenario setup for Iterated Race (irace).
############################################################################

## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir = "./"

## File that contains the description of the parameters of the target
## algorithm.
parameterFile = "./parameters.txt"


## File that contains a table of initial configurations. If empty or NULL, all
## initial configurations are randomly generated.
configurationsFile = "./configurations.txt"

## Directory where training instances are located; either absolute path or
## relative to current directory. If no trainInstancesFiles is provided, all
## the files in trainInstancesDir will be listed as instances.
trainInstancesDir = ""

## File that contains a list of training instances and optionally additional
## parameters for them. If trainInstancesDir is provided, irace will search
## for the files in this folder.
trainInstancesFile = "./instances-list.txt"

## Executable called for each configuration that executes the target algorithm
## to be tuned. See the templates and examples provided.
targetRunner = "./target-runner"

## If the target algorithm is deterministic, configurations will be evaluated
## only once per instance.
deterministic = 0

## Maximum number of runs (invocations of targetRunner) that will be
## performed. It determines the maximum budget of experiments for the tuning.
maxExperiments = 1000

## Number of calls to targetRunner to execute in parallel. Values 0 or 1
## mean no parallelization.
parallel = 4
